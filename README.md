# Philosophers:
TODO



## Definitions:
* Data Races: Occur when multiple tasks or threads access a shared resource without sufficient protections
* Mutex: MUTual EXclusion - Protect the execution again other threads running at the same time.
* Semaphore: Some kind of mutex, but with counter

## Parameters:
* **number_of_philosophers**: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
* **time_to_die**: (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.
* **time_to_eat**: (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
* **time_to_sleep**: (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
* **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat**: (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least _this parametrized_ times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.
